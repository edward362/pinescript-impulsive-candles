## 🧩 Overview

The **Impulsive Candles Indicator** is a *TradingView Pine Script v6* tool designed to automatically highlight impulsive price moves, moments of strong participation and directional intent, without requiring traders to read order flow or footprint charts (maybe because they can't afford to buy aggregated or non-aggregated datafeed).  

It acts as a **visual proxy for order flow imbalance**, combining **volatility (ATR)**, **volume strength**, and **candle body dominance** to detect when the market transitions from passive to aggressive trading behavior.  

This makes it particularly useful for:
- Discretionary traders who **don’t use DOM or footprint charts**  
- Scalpers looking to **spot aggressive buyers/sellers early**  
- Algorithmic traders who need **quantifiable triggers for impulsive activity**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The indicator filters candles based on a 3-part condition:
1. **ATR Range Filter** → The bar’s total range must exceed a multiple of its average true range (`range ≥ ATR × multiplier`).
2. **Volume Confirmation** → Volume must be significantly higher than the recent moving average of volume (`volume ≥ volMA × multiplier`).
3. **Body Structure** → The candle’s body must represent a minimum percentage of the total range, filtering out wicks and noise.

If all conditions are satisfied:
- The candle is colored **teal** (bullish impulse) or **fuchsia** (bearish impulse).  
- **Midline** and **target zones** (BS/SS + TP) are automatically drawn using body size.  
- **Labels** help identify where a continuation or reaction might occur.

## 📊 Why It Helps Traders

In fast markets, **not everyone uses footprint or delta-based tools**, but impulsive movement *always* leaves a footprint on price, range, and volume.  
This script visually encapsulates that data, allowing traders to:
- Detect **localized liquidity imbalances**  
- Anticipate **stop runs or structural shifts**  
- Align entries with **market-generated momentum**  
- Use impulse candles as **anchor points for setups**

It bridges the gap between **price action** and **order flow**, providing a “lite” version of order flow context *right on the chart.*

</p>

**What you’re seeing:**  
- The indicator highlights **impulsive candles** using three simultaneous filters:  
  **ATR× range expansion**, **volume vs. volMA**, and **body-percent dominance**.  
- **Fuchsia bars** → bearish impulses (aggressive selling) | **Teal bars** → bullish impulses (aggressive buying).  
- The small **gray labels** above each impulse (e.g. 2.50, 3.00, 1.75) show the **Range ÷ ATR** ratio, quantifying how strong each candle’s move is relative to background volatility.

**How to interpret this chart:**  
- Early in the session, several **bearish impulses** (2.50 – 3.00) reveal a **dominant sell-side imbalance**, showing that liquidity is being consumed aggressively to the downside.  
- A lone **teal 1.75 impulse** marks short-covering and temporary absorption, but the following **fuchsia 2.00** bar confirms renewed sell-side aggression.  
- Later, around 16:00, another **2.25 impulse** prints, finalizing the cluster before volatility compresses.

**The practical takeaway:**  
Clusters of impulsive candles help traders **anchor directional bias** and **time entries**.  
For example, favoring **pullback shorts** into prior impulsive zones when bearish impulses dominate,  
or staying flat when the tape stops printing new impulses.  

To support this visually, each impulsive candle automatically plots a **midline at 50% of its body**,  
giving **price-action traders a reference for likely retracement zones**.  
These midlines often align with **Fibonacci retracement areas (50% – 61.8%)**,  
allowing traders to anticipate where price may **pull back before continuation**,  
without needing a footprint or order-flow chart.

> 🧭 In short, the combination of impulse clusters + body-midline levels  
> provides a clean, order-flow-aware framework derived entirely from price action,  
> perfect for discretionary traders who want context without raw delta data.

## 🔍 Why This Reflects Order Flow Imbalance

<p align="center">

</p>

On the **left**, we see what the **Impulsive Candles Indicator** highlights on a standard 15-minute chart — a **fuchsia impulsive candle** with an ATR ratio of `2.25×`.  
To a regular chart user, this simply looks like a strong bearish candle, but the indicator is actually flagging an event of **true order flow imbalance**.

If we **zoom into the same candle on a footprint chart** (image on the right), we uncover the real structure of that move:
- The candle corresponds to a **large negative delta of -162.56K**, meaning **massive aggressive selling** overwhelmed liquidity on the bid side.
- Volume was concentrated at the lower half of the bar, leaving behind an **inefficient auction** — a zone where sellers pushed too aggressively, creating an unbalanced price area with very few passive buyers.

In the following bars, we observe a **bullish retracement** where delta flips to **+676**, but price climbs efficiently through the same zone with **minimal buying effort**.  
This is a classic footprint signature of an **imbalanced-to-balanced transition** — the market revisiting an inefficiency left by prior aggressive selling, now efficiently re-auctioned by buyers.

What makes the **Impulsive Candles Indicator** so powerful is that it allows non–order flow traders to **infer this hidden imbalance visually**, without needing a footprint chart:
- The **fuchsia impulse** instantly signals where an inefficiency (thin liquidity zone) was created.  
- The **midline** drawn at the 50 % of the candle’s body provides a reference for where a **retracement is likely to rebalance liquidity**.  
- Traders can anticipate **bullish retracements** into these zones (as seen above) or look for **continuations** if the inefficiency remains unfilled.

In other words, this indicator acts as a **bridge between price action and order flow**, distilling complex microstructural information into a single visual cue.

> 💡 The practical takeaway: impulsive candles mark where **aggressive participation** disrupted the auction process.  
> These levels tend to attract price later as the market rebalances — allowing traders to profit from **retracements into prior imbalanced zones** without ever needing to open a footprint chart.
